# RP FourThousand EA MT5

RP FourThousand EA MT5 is a Forex trading robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This expert advisor (EA) utilizes the Keltner Channel indicator to generate entry signals and optimize trades.

## Product Description

RP FourThousand EA MT5 is designed to help traders optimize their trades using the Keltner Channels. The Keltner Channel is a technical indicator that consists of an upper and lower band, derived from the Average True Range (ATR). This indicator helps identify potential breakout points and market volatility.

The EA calculates the Keltner Channel by taking the average of the True Range over a specified period. It then adds and subtracts a multiple of the ATR to the moving average to create the upper and lower bands. The Entry Threshold parameter determines the multiple of the ATR used for defining the bands.

The EA checks for entry signals based on the position of the closing price relative to the Keltner Channel bands. If the closing price crosses above the upper band, a buy signal is generated. Conversely, if the closing price crosses below the lower band, a sell signal is generated.

Traders can customize the parameters of the EA to suit their trading preferences. The KeltnerPeriod parameter sets the period for calculating the Keltner Channel, while the ATRPeriod sets the period for calculating the Average True Range. The EntryThreshold parameter determines the threshold for entry signals.

## How it Works
